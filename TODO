- Update to latest eventmachine compatibility (the basic auth options 
  syntax has changed and evented sending is currently broken if you're 
  using the latest eventmachine)

- Replace the curb method with the latest ruby httpclient which 
  should be faster: http://dev.ctor.org/http-access2/

- add a way to choose whether the email should be sent as bulk or 
  non-bulk (all are assumed to be non-bulk at present)

- add additional tracking/monitoring features avilable via 
  hellocreature.com once you log in.
