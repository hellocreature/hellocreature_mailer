Instructions:

Install libcurl:
  
  sudo aptitude install libcurl4-openssl-dev

Install curb:

  sudo gem install curb
  sudo gem install eventmachine  (if you prefer to send mail very fast).

Require the gem in config/initializers/hellocreature_mailer.rb
  require 'eventmachine'

  or

  require 'curb'

Set up your Rails config to use hellocreature_mailer

  ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :hellocreature
  ActionMailer::Base.hellocreature_mailer_settings = {:email => 'your@email', :api_key => 'secret'}

By default it will use Curl::Easy from the curb gem, but if you specify :evented => true it will use Eventmachine and 
be much faster.

  ActionMailer::Base.hellocreature_mailer_settings = {:email => 'your@email', 
                                                      :api_key => 'secret', 
                                                      :evented => true}
  
If you want to send mail very fast, you just need to create an event loop around your call to deliver the message:

(If you are using Mongrel, Thin, etc., there is already a an event loop 
reactor running so you can just call the normal deliver method.)

EM.run do
  User.recent_signups.each do |user|
    UserMailer.deliver_confirmation_email(user)
  end
end


Your mails will be signed by your DKIM authenticator in 
HelloCreature and also stamped with HashCash prior to being sent.
