Instructions:

Get your API Key:

  Just log into your HelloCreature account and click on "Installation Instructions" under the Setup menu.
  Your API key will be all the way at the bottom.

  If you don't have an account, it's quick to set one up and we only charge $0.005 per email sent.

Install EventMachine

  sudo gem install eventmachine 

Or install libcurl and curb:
  
  sudo aptitude install libcurl4-openssl-dev
  sudo gem install curb

Then set up your Rails config to use hellocreature_mailer

  ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :hellocreature
  ActionMailer::Base.hellocreature_mailer_settings = {:email => 'your@email', :api_key => 'secret'}

  
If you are not otherwise using an event loop and want to send mail very fast, you just need to create an event loop 
around your call to deliver the message:

(If you are using Mongrel, Thin, etc., there is already a an event loop 
reactor running so you can just call the normal deliver method.)

EM.run do
  User.recent_signups.each do |user|
    UserMailer.deliver_confirmation_email(user)
  end
end


Your mails will be signed by your DKIM and DomainKeys authenticators in 
HelloCreature and also stamped with HashCash prior to being sent.
